This is an Alexa / Echo skill to allow football (soccer) enthusiasts to get information about Premier League.
It consists of several components:
- an index.js file that is the code for the main lambda of the skill
- a voice interaction model that represents the conversational interface between Alexa and a human user
- a web scraper that implements a lambda to build data files for the skill from the official Premier League website.
