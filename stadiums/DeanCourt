Dean Court, currently known as the Vitality Stadium for sponsorship purposes,is the home ground of A.F.C. Bournemouth.  In May 2016, AFC Bournemouth announced that it will not be adding new capacity to its ground in time for the next Premier League season. The club has taken the decision to delay redevelopment plans following a meeting of its board. A statement from the Cherries blamed "ongoing negotiations with the club's landlord to purchase the stadium". The club had previously said improving the stadium's size was needed as "demand for tickets far outweighs our current capacity". Dean Court remains the smallest ground in the Premier League.

In December 2016 the club announced plans to find a new site due to the ongoing issues regarding ownership of the ground
