The King Power Stadium is the home of Leicester City.
The King Power Stadium has four stands that each join in an enclosed design and, like many other football stadia in England, its stands are named for the cardinal points of the compass (i.e. The North, East, South and West Stands respectively). The away supporters are in the corner between the North and East Stand. The North Stand is referred to as the Family Stand or Family Area, and the South Stand is known by fans as 'The Kop.'
