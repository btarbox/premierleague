London Stadium (originally known as the Olympic Stadium) is a stadium in Stratford, London, England, hosting West Ham United. It was constructed to serve as the home stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, hosting the track and field events and opening and closing ceremonies. West Ham United play at the stadium, having moved from their former Boleyn Ground in August 2016. The club announced in March 2013 that the stands behind the goals will be named after former players Bobby Moore and Trevor Brooking; there were stands at the Boleyn Ground named after them.
