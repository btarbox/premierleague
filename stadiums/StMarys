St. Mary's Stadium in Southampton, England, has been the home stadium of Southampton F.C. since 2001. The stadium has a capacity of 32,505 and is currently the largest football stadium in the south of England, outside of London. The stadium has four stands, which are named after the areas of Southampton they face. The main (east) stand is the Itchen Stand, and faces the River Itchen. The opposite stand is called the Kingsland Stand. Behind the south goal is the Chapel Stand, and to the north is the Northam Stand.

At the rear of the Chapel, Kingsland and Northam Stands, there is a continuous, translucent 'panel' that is designed to allow light to access the pitch.
